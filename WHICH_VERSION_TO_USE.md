# Which Version Should I Use?

## Your Current Setup

You have **TWO different projects**:

1. **TypeScript MCP Server** (Google-Workspace-Integration)
   - Uses MCP (Model Context Protocol)
   - Works with Claude Desktop
   - Communicates via stdin/stdout
   - AI assistant focused

2. **Python Flask API** (Google-Workspace)
   - REST API
   - Works with HTTP clients
   - General purpose

## Use Cases

### ✅ Use TypeScript MCP (What you have configured)

**When:**
- You want to use it **with Claude Desktop**
- You want Claude (the AI) to automatically access your Google Workspace
- You're interacting with Claude Desktop

**Keep your current claude_desktop_config.json AS IS**

### ✅ Use Python Flask API

**When:**
- You're building a **web application**
- You need a **REST API** for other services
- You're writing **custom scripts** or tools
- You want to use it from **JavaScript/frontend**
- You want to integrate with **mobile apps**

## What You Should Do

### Keep Both Projects

1. **TypeScript MCP** (Google-Workspace-Integration)
   - Keep your `claude_desktop_config.json` as it is
   - Use with Claude Desktop
   - Start with: `npm start` (in that directory)

2. **Python Flask** (Google-Workspace)
   - Use for web apps, scripts, or other services
   - Start with: `python app.py` (in this directory)

### Don't Change Your claude_desktop_config.json

**Leave it as-is** because it's correctly configured for the TypeScript MCP server.

The Python Flask API is **NOT** an MCP server and **CANNOT** be used with Claude Desktop's MCP configuration.

## Running Both

```bash
# Terminal 1 - TypeScript MCP (for Claude Desktop)
cd "C:\Users\chait\OneDrive\Desktop\Drexel University\MSAIML Books and Materials\Future Projects\Google-Workspace-Integration"
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Python Flask (for web apps)
cd "C:\Users\chait\OneDrive\Desktop\Drexel University\MSAIML Books and Materials\Future Projects\Google-Workspace"
python app.py
```

## Summary

| Tool | Use With | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| TypeScript MCP | Claude Desktop | AI assistant integration |
| Python Flask | Web apps, scripts | General REST API |

**Your claude_desktop_config.json is already correct for the TypeScript version. Don't change it!**
